            <h1>Edakkal Caves</h1>
            A trip to Edakkal Caves is like a journey into a forgotten past. They have provided historians with great information 
            regarding the lives and habits of the ancestors here.
            The caves are two natural rock formations believed to have been formed by a large split in a huge rock. 
            The carvings inside are extremely beautiful. A trek up the majestic Ambukuthi Hills is required to reach these caves. 
            The aroma of coffee stays with you the entire way. It is truly a surreal experience to step into the palms of history.
