    <div class="description">
        <p> A famous port of international spice trade in ancient India, the present day Kollam is famous for its varied modern industries 
        including cashew nut processing and research. Its association with the renowned Ashtamudi Lake makes it 
        the gateway to the magnificent backwaters of Kerala. As an old seaport town on the Malabar Coast, Kollam
        had a sustained commercial reputation from the days of the Phoenicians and the Romans.
