        nostalgic colonial legacy. Built upon seven hills, this city has hitorically been used by seafaring explorers. Today, Trivandrum is an 
        expensive metropolis with quaint urban charm and plenty of 
        architectural and historical places to visit. In addition, Trivandrum is a gateway to nearby popular beach towns of
